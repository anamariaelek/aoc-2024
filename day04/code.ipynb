    "As the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she'd like to know if you could help her with her word search (your puzzle input). She only has to find one word: `XMAS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of `XMAS` - you need to find all of them. Here are a few ways `XMAS` might appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with `.`:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this word search, `XMAS` occurs a total of 18 times; here's the same word search again, but where letters not involved in any `XMAS` have been replaced with `.`:\n",
    "\n",
